# Machine Learning and Statistics

This repository contains my work for the Machine Learning and Statistics Module at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics). 

# Overview

This repository contains a `Practicals` folder which has two parts:

1. `Regular Tasks`
2. `Machine Learning Project Notebook.ipynb`

The `Regular Tasks` contains 4 Jupyter Notebooks, each containing exercises from each topic we explored over the course of the module. 

- `1-Statistics.ipynb`
- `2-Models.ipynb`
- `3-Parameters.ipynb`
- `4-Machine Learning.ipynb`

The `Regular Tasks` folder also contains a `content` and `examples` folder. This holds images and data used in the Jupyter Notebooks. 

The `Machine Learning Project Notebook.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook contains my work exploring the <a href="https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_anomaly_detection/" target="_blank">Keras: Time series anomaly detection using an Autoencoder</a> blog post. 

# Instructions to Reader

To download and run my Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine: 

To do:
1. Go to my repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/ShaneOG2/machstat-assessment).
2. Click on the green `<> Code` button and `Download Zip`.
3. Save folder to your local machine. 
4. Navigate to where you have save the `Practicals` on your machine using your command line. 
5. Type `jupyter notebook` - this will open and run Jupyter Notebooks in your browser. From there you will be able to run each of the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository. 

# Python Libraries

At the start of each Jupyter Notebook I have outlined which libraries I am using. Below is a brief description of each library. 

- `math` module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.. 
- `itertools` Iterate over data structures that can be stepped over using a for-loop. . 
- `random` is used to generate random numbers.. 
- `collections` for specialized container datatypes. 
- `scipy.stats` module provides large number of probability distributions, summary and frequency statistics, correlation functions and statistical tests etc.. 
- `statsmodels.stats` Alternative statistical package. 
- `numpy` is a library used for working with arrays. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these. 
- `pandas` data analysis and manipulation tool. 
- `matplotlib.pyplot` is used for customised data visualisations. 
- `matplotlib.ticker` more functionality for matplotlib. 
- `matplotlib.mdates` more functionality for matplotlib. 
- `seaborn` uses matplotlib and is also used for data visualisations. 
- `tensorflow` is a library or machine learning, neural networks and artificial intelligence. 
- `keras` is similiar to `tensorflow`. 
- `os` uses operating system dependent functionality.
